                        This is my cat Hazel! She is a year old but I've had her for almost 6 months now and have grown quite close to her. This picture is from a video I recorded a while back for my Computer Graphics class where we had to code filters on videos. The original video in that assignment was a video of Vector dancing, but I decided to get a funny video of Hazel instead. This screenshot has a ripple effect/filter over the photo and I thought it was funny.

                        This is a fun little picture of me and my friends hanging out on a slide as many college students still do. You may notice that my hair was blond in the photo, and regretfully you are correct. I made a deal with one of my friends that if I ever lose 100lbs, I would die my hair. 8 months later, I actually did it and my friends held me to my word.

                        Lastly, this is a picture of my friend Connor giving me a tattoo. He's been learning for quite some time and was willing to give me a tattoo for free in our house. I have 5 tattoos on my leg, but I'm shooting for more even though my parents are very against it. Thankfully it didn't hurt too much and I personally love the tattoo he gave me. Unfortunately I cannot show it off since it is on my outer thy and my underweaar covers it.                    </p>
