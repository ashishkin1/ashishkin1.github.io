                        This Project was all about Illumination. Computer Graphics was one of the more challenging classes I completed, but I had the most fun in that class. In this assignment, we were instructed to create objects in a 3D space, and code the renderers for two different types of shading (Gouraud and Phong). After completing the renderers, the hard part was being creative enough to make a scene in 3D that was interesting. We were required to have 15 triangles to generate our 3D objects and I think this scene was the best when it came to being creative! Overall, this assignment was tricky, but really fun once you were able to overcome the tough parts!

                        This "assignment" was more of a punishment then anything else. In my CISC 340 class, I had an attitude and always tried to argue with Professor Sawin whenever I thought I was right. Professor Sawin was notorious for assigning these 0 point "homeworks" to punish students. For context, we were talking about a Muppets song called "hole in the bucket". With me not thinking, I butted in saying "That is not a song!". Because of this, Professor Sawin took 5 minutes out of our day to play the song infront of everyone while staring me down. I then was assigned to write an "In Depth" analysis of the song. I know a little bit about music and music theory, so I decided to go as hard as I could, trying to make ridiculous comparrisions. I read this analysis in front of the class as punishment, but I felt like I won in the end.

                        This project was one the hardest assignments I have ever completed here at St Thomas. I am quite proud of how it ended up (I think my Partner and I got a 37/40).

                        With some context, this was our final unit in CISC 380, Computer Algorithms. My partner and I were barely keeping afloat with around a low 70% in class. We needed to get a good score on this assignment or else we would literally fail the class. With the stakes so high, my partner and I were terrified knowing that the final assignment was the hardest. We decided to split the assignment in half, with my partner focusing on Greedy Algorithms while I focused on Dynamic Programming. I think I spent around 55+ hours trying to figure out how to get our program to even work, with another 5-6 hours spent on coding the Latex. I remember missing out on so many things just to try and get this assignment completed. My partner was done with his half in the first 2-3 days, so me finally completing my part was an amazing feeling. (We later found out that the first half of the assignment was easy, meaning I took on the challenge alone). Looking back, this class made me into a strong coder, but this assignment could have ended it all for me.
